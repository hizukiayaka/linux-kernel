V4L2_PIX_FMT_P016 ('P016')
******************************************************


V4L2_PIX_FMT_P016
Formats with Â½ horizontal and vertical chroma resolution. One luminance and
one chrominance plane with alternating
chroma samples as simliar to ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_NV12``


Description
===========

It is a two-plane versions of the YUV 4:2:0 format. The three
components are separated into two sub-images or planes. The Y plane is
first. The Y plane has 16 bits per pixel. For ``V4L2_PIX_FMT_P016``, a
combined CbCr plane immediately follows the Y plane in memory. The CbCr
plane is the same width, in bytes, as the Y plane (and of the image),
but is half as tall in pixels. Each CbCr pair belongs to four pixels.
For example, Cb\ :sub:`0`/Cr\ :sub:`0` belongs to Y'\ :sub:`00`,
Y'\ :sub:`01`, Y'\ :sub:`10`, Y'\ :sub:`11`.
If the Y plane has pad bytes after each row, then the CbCr plane has as
many pad bytes after its rows.

**Byte Order.**
Each cell is two bytes.
